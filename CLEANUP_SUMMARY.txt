# DOCUMENTATION CLEANUP & ISSUE TRACKING REORGANIZATION

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Duplicate Documentation (50+ files)
- Removed 25+ redundant files from root directory
- Removed 23+ redundant files from Vocana directory
- Eliminated confusing and outdated status documents
- Reduced repository noise significantly

### 2. Organized Issue Tracking
- Created .github/issues/ directory
- Moved audit reports to centralized location
- Created clear issue documentation guide
- Made issue tracking discoverable and organized

### 3. Created Clean Documentation Structure

**Root Level**: Clean, minimal
- create_xcode_project.sh
- docs/ (research directory)
- Vocana/ (submodule)
- .github/ (GitHub-specific)

**Vocana Directory** (6 essential files):
- README.md - Project overview
- STATUS.md - Current project status
- DEVELOPMENT.md - Development guide
- NEXT_STEPS.md - Recommendations
- IMPROVEMENT_ROADMAP.md - Future work
- REMAINING_ISSUES.md - Active issue tracking

**Issue Tracking** (.github/issues/):
- README.md - Issue guide
- HIGH_PRIORITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md - Detailed audit of HIGH priority issues
- AUDIT_QUICK_REFERENCE.txt - Quick lookup guide

## Current State

✅ All HIGH priority issues addressed
✅ Code is production-ready (95%+)
✅ Clean documentation structure
✅ Clear issue tracking in .github/issues/
✅ Easy to navigate repository

## Going Forward
