                        HOW IT ADDRESSES FEEDBACK
================================================================================

Original PR #25 Concern: "Introduces concerning complexity"

Our Response:
  ✅ Split into focused changes (security only in Phase 1)
  ✅ No architectural changes (deferred to Phase 3)
  ✅ No unverified performance claims (Phase 2 will provide baselines)
  ✅ Fixed weak test assertions (3 tautological tests fixed)
  ✅ Simplified scope (306 lines vs 497 lines)
  ✅ Comprehensive documentation (addressing reviewer concerns)

Result: Following exact recommendation for "incremental, well-tested 
improvements rather than one massive refactoring"
